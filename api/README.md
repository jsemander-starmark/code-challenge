# Code Challenge - API
Wire up the api to save users, encrypt the password, and decrypt the password to authenticate the user. If you have time, you are provided mocha and chai to create unit tests, unit tests are not required, but will help you.

Technology:
* Docker
* NodeJS w/ Typescript

Most components have already been provided, but there are some TODO tags that will need your discretion.

Make sure to explain be able to explain the follow:

* What database you choose, and why?
* If you used a ORM, why did you choose it? If so, what are the advantages to using it?
* Why you implemented a specific piece of code?

Feel free to reach out to if you have an issue, this is more about understanding your process than right or wrong. (Although it would be highly advised to understand what has already been explained/provide or googled before you reach out)

If you use google, try not to copy code directly from Stackoverflow or other forum sites, although they are useful, they are not the best example of your coding style, and do not help you understand why it fixes your issue.
