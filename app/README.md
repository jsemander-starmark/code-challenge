# Code Challenge - App
With your api wired, create 2 pages in ionic/angular (preferably the latest and greatest):

* Allow the user to authenticate
* Once and only once they are authenticated, the user should be able to view their information

Technology:
* Ionic 4+
* Angular 7+

This will take most of the time, because you are expected to take a project from scratch, and build out the auth guards and routing.

Make sure to explain be able to explain the follow:

* Why you choose a specific folder structure?
* Why you structured the Modules/Components?
* Why you implemented a specific piece of code?

Feel free to reach out to if you have an issue, this is more about understanding your process than right or wrong. (Although it would be highly advised to understand what has already been explained/provide or googled before you reach out)

If you use google, try not to copy code directly from Stackoverflow or other forum sites, although they are useful, they are not the best example of your coding style, and do not help you understand why it fixes your issue.
